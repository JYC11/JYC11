# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jaeyoon


## About
* Backend Developer
* Most experienced in Python but always willing to learn and use other tech
* I used Kotlin/Spring at Smatch Corporation
* I also sometimes do workshops at CodeSeoul, a non-profit organization. Here are some of my talks:

## Currently Studying
* Mainly focusing on Compilers now
  * I wrote an intepreter in python by following a book: https://github.com/JYC11/py-monkey-interpreted 
* Bits and pieces of reading here and there
* Sometimes a bit of CS theory, sometimes a bit of Software Engineering theory

## WIP project: FastAPI template
* https://github.com/JYC11/fastapi-template
* iterating on the project below but really reducing the scope so I can flesh out some parts of the project I wasn't satisfied about
* things I'm improving: dynamic repository depdency injection in unit of work, hopefully simpler depdency injection in message bus, better error handling/logging, adding a job store ...
* It's almost done I think!

## Most Recent Project(s) displaying my skills
* https://github.com/JYC11/fastapi-bug-tracker
* Architecture Patterns With Python inspired project
* It implements a bug tracking feature(like Jira) with user auth
* Tech used: Python 3.10, Fastapi, Sqlalchemy, Asyncpg
* Trying to get it as close to production/professional quality as possible
* I abandoned it after getting a new job while doing this project and got very busy getting used to the new work place
